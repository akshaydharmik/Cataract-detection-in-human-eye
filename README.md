# Cataract-detection-in-human-eye
- This Repo contains a Deep learning based cataract detection project files.<br>
- This project classifies whether person has cataract or not based on his eye images <br>
- I used transfer learning to build and train the model.<br>
- used checkpoints to stop training at appropriate epoch , to prevent overfitting
- I tried and experimented with different models , for example : VGG16 , Inception V3 and Resnet50 and found that Inception V3 gives the best accuracy
- Dataset size : 1200 Images
- depolyed it on local machine using FLASK
