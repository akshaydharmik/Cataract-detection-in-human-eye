# Cataract-detection-in-human-eye
This Repo contains a Deep learning based cataract detection project files
This project uses transfer learning to classify whether person has cataract or not based on his eye images
I used transfer learning to do build the model
I tried and experimented with different models : for example : VGG16 , Inception V3 and Resnet50 and found that Inception V3 gives the best accuracy
